# Stock Ticker Interview Problem

## Dependencies
The provided StockTicker module (ticker.js) emits stock changes. While you should take advantage of this module, there is no need to modify this file directly.

## Challenge
Write an HTML/CSS/Javascript module that listens for these events and displays them. 

1) Ticker events should be shown in a list, with the most recent events at the top or in a position of priority. 
2) Each event should show the stock ticker, stock price, and the change.
